# Zama - Private and secure applications with fully homomorphic encryption

Zama builds state-of-the-art, open-source solutions to protect privacy in blockchain and AI
**Founders:** Dr Rand Hindi (CEO), Pascal Paillier (CTO)
**Sector:** cryptography
**Stage Invested:** Pre-seed 
**Co-Investors:** Protocol Labs, Multicoin Capital

**Problem**
From data breaches and surveillance of cloud applications, to blockchain smart contracts where everything is public, doing things privately online is becoming increasingly complicated. The only way to solve this is to make everything encrypted end-to-end, regardless of where the application is running. And the only way this can happen is if homomorphic encryption becomes mainstream.

**Insight**
Zama provides open-source cryptographic tools for developers to build privacy-preserving applications with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE is somewhat of a holy grail in the security industry, but has for decades been too slow to be practical. A recent breakthrough by Pascal Paillier, Zama's CTO, has made FHE practical for the first time. They have two main products, ConcreteML, a privacy preserving machine learning framework and fhEVM, private smart contracts on the EVM using homomorphic encryption. 

**Vision**
Imagine if you could send your sensitive data to the cloud or any data processor for processing. Imagine if you didn’t have to process your data on your own servers or in your own country. Imagine if you never had to worry about GDPR or personally identifiable information (PII) ever again. Zama is reimagining data security and the entire digital economy. Data is locked in silos on servers around the world because it needs to be confidential. But Zama enables all data to remain encrypted even while processed. No-one ever has to make the distinction between personal and non-personal data. Or on-premises and cloud. Or trusted and non-trusted data processors. The complexity and cost of data management goes away. Instead of hoarding and spending money to protect data, individuals and companies can share and collaborate on data. Zama enables the next-generation of private-by-default private and secure applications.
